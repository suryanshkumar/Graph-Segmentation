# Application of Graph segmentation algorithm for image segmentation.

This algorithm for graph-segmentation was originally 
developed by Pedro F. Felzenszwalb. Its C++ implementation 
is freely available by him under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

The motivation behind writing this code is to make this algorithm compatible with different image formats. 
Moreover, OpenCV is one of the most widely used computer vision library, which makes this algorithm more 
flexible to use. 

In addition to this, Robot vision platform rarely uses raw image formats(.ppm, .pgm etc), most of the 
time compressed image formats (say .jpg) are used. Hence, this algorithm can now be easily integrated 
with commonly used robot platform ROS(Robot Operating System). 

To run this version of Software you must have few dependencies installed 

a. OpenCV

b. cmake

Compilation Instructions:

a. cd GraphSegmentation (folder_ containing_GraphSegmentation_source)

b. mkdir build

c. cmake ..

d. make

Your binary will be in build/apps.
Example image has been provided with this code in img folder to test quickly.

Execution command
a) ./graph_segmentation ../../img/339.jpg 

   ./(name_of_binary) (path_to_image)
